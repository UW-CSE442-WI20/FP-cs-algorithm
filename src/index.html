            <h2>Perfect Matching:</h2>
            <div>A perfect matching is a matching of men and women in which everyone is matched monogamously. Each man gets exactly one woman and each woman gets exactly one man.</div>

            <h2>Unstable Pairs:</h2>
            <div>In a matching A, an unmatched pair M-W is unstable if man M and woman W prefer each other to their current partners. <br /> For example consider the following matching with the pairs Jim-Angela and Dwight-Pam:</div>
            <div id="explanation"></div>
            <!-- svg appended in explanation.js -->

            <div>The green lines above represent the current pairs in the matching A.
                <br> Suppose:
                <br> 1) Jim prefers Pam over Angela and
                <br> 2) Pam prefers Jim over Dwight
                <br> Then the pair Jim-Pam (represented by the green line above) is an unstable pair because both Jim and Pam prefer each other over their current partners.</div>

            <h2>Stable Matching:</h2>
            <div>A perfect matching with no unstable pairs is called a stable matching.</div>

            <h2>Stable Matching Problem:</h2>
            <div>Given the preference lists of n men and n women, find a stable matching if one exists.
            </div>

        </div>
        <h1>The Solution</h1>
        <h2>Algorithm:</h2>
        <div>In 1962, <b>David Gale</b> and <b>Lloyd Shapley</b> proved that, for any equal number of men and women, it is always possible to make all marriages stable.
            <br />
            <br /> The <b>Gale–Shapley algorithm</b> involves a number of <i>"rounds"</i>:
            <ul type="square">
                <li>In the first round, first
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>Each unengaged man proposes to the woman he prefers most, and then </li>
                        <li>Each woman replies <i>"maybe"</i> to her suitor she most prefers and <i>"no"</i> to all other suitors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    She is then provisionally <i>"engaged"</i> to the suitor she most prefers so far, and that suitor is likewise provisionally engaged to her.
                </li>
                <li>In each subsequent round, first
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each unengaged man proposes to the most-preferred woman to whom he has not yet proposed (regardless of whether the woman is already engaged), and then</li>
                        <li>Each woman replies <i>"maybe"</i> if she is currently not engaged or if she prefers this man over her current provisional partner (in this case, her current provisional partner becomes unengaged).</li>
                    </ul>
                    This allows every already-engaged woman to <i>"trade up"</i> (and reject her until-then partner)
                </li>
                <li>This process is repeated until everyone is engaged.</li>
            </ul>
            This algorithm is guaranteed to produce a stable marriage for all participants in time \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the number of men or women.

            <br /> Among all possible different stable matchings, it always yields the one that is best for all men among all stable matchings, and worst for all women. No man can get a better matching for himself by misrepresenting his preferences, and no group of men can coordinate a misrepresentation of their preferences such that all men in the group are strictly better-off. However, it is possible for some group of men to misrepresent their preferences such that some men are better-off and the other men retain the same partner. 
			However, each woman may be able to misrepresent her preferences and get a better match.

        <h2>Applications:</h2>
        <div>Algorithms for finding solutions to the stable marriage problem have applications in a variety of real-world situations, perhaps the best known of these being in the assignment of graduating medical students to their first hospital appointments.
 Many applications for the Gale-Shapley algorithm were the work of Harvard economist Alvin Roth. In the 1980s, he applied the algorithm to the National Residency Match Program (NRMP), a program that paired new doctors to hospitals around the country.
             Roth also applied the Gale-Shapley algorithm to public schooling. In New York City, students are able to select their school via a ranking system. However, the process was broken, with around 30,000 students being left unmatched each year. The new system was implemented in 2004, and the number of unmatched students plummeted from 30,000 to 3,000.
			 Also in 2004, Roth used the algorithm to help transplant patients find donors. His system helped incompatible donor-recepient pairs find others in the same situation, and trade places with them. This has allowed thousands of people to receive a kidney transplant when it was previously impossible. This breakthrough won both Roth and Shapley the Nobel Prize in economics in 2012.
            <br />
            <br /> Another important and large-scale application of stable marriage is in the problem of assigning users to web servers.
             of users access web pages, videos, and other services on the Internet, requiring each user to be matched to one of potentially hundreds of thousands of servers around the world. A user prefers servers that are closer to them, resulting in a (partial) preferential ordering of the servers for each user. Each server prefers to serve users that it can with a lower cost, resulting in a (partial) preferential ordering of users for each server.
             Content delivery networks that distribute much of the world's content and services solve this large and complex stable marriage problem between users and servers every several seconds to enable billions of users to be matched up with their respective servers.

                <li><b>Stable Matching with Indifference:</b> In this problem some men might be indifferent between two or more women and vice versa.</li>
                <li><b>Stable Roommates Problem: </b>This problem is similar to the stable marriage problem, but differs in that all participants belong to a single pool (instead of being divided into equal numbers of <i>"men"</i> and <i>"women"</i>).</li>
                <li><b>Hospitals/Residents Problem:</b> This problem – also known as the <b>college admissions problem </b>– differs from the stable marriage problem in that a hospital can take multiple residents, or a college can take an incoming class of more than one student. Algorithms to solve the hospitals/residents problem can be hospital-oriented or resident-oriented. This problem was solved, with an algorithm, in the same original paper by Gale and Shapley, in which the stable marriage problem was solved.</li>
                <li><b>Hospitals/Residents Problem with couples:</b> This problem allows the set of residents to include couples who must be assigned together, either to the same hospital or to a specific pair of hospitals chosen by the couple (e.g., a married couple want to ensure that they will stay together and not be stuck in programs that are far away from each other). The addition of couples to the hospitals/residents problem renders the problem NP-complete, which means that it cannot be solved in polynomial time as the Stable Matching Problem.</li>
                <li><b>Assignment Problem:</b> This problem seeks to find a matching in a weighted bipartite graph that has maximum weight. Maximum weighted matchings do not have to be stable, but in some applications a maximum weighted matching is better than a stable one.</li>
                <li><b>Matching with Contracts Problem:</b> This problem is a generalization of matching problem, in which participants can be matched with different terms of contracts. An important special case of contracts is matching with flexible wages</li>
