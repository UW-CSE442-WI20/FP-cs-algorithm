    <h2>The Problem</h2>
	<div>
		<h3>Perfect Matching:</h3>
		<div>A perfect matching is a matching of men and weomen in which everyone is matched
	monogamously. Each man gets exactly one woman and each woman gets exactly one man.</div>

		<h3>Unstable Pairs:</h3>
		<div>In a matching A, an unmatched pair M-W is unstable if man M and woman W prefer
		each other to their current partners.
		For example consider the following matching with the pairs M1-W1 and M2-W2:</div>
		<div id="problem-explanation1"></div> <!-- svg appended in explanation.js -->
		
		<div>The green lines above represent the current pairs in the matching A.<br>
		Suppose:<br>
		  1) M1 prefers W2 to W1 and<br>
		  2) W2 prefers M1 to M2<br>
		Then the pair M1-W2 (represented by the red line above) is an unstable pair
		because both M1 and W2 prefer each other to their current partners.</div>

		<h3>Stable Matching:</h3>
		<div>A perfect matching with no unstable pairs is called a stable matching.</div>

		<h3>Stable Matching Problem:</h3>
		<div>Given the preference lists of n men and n women, find a stable matching if one
		exists.</div>
