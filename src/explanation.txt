Perfect Matching:
A perfect matching is a matching of men and weomen in which everyone is matched
monogamously. Each man gets exactly one woman and each woman gets exactly one man.

Unstable Pairs:
In a matching A, an unmatched pair M-W is unstable if man M and woman W prefer
each other to their current partners.
For example consider the following matching with the pairs M1-W1 and M2-W2:
                            <diagram>
The green lines above represent the current pairs in the matching A.
Suppose:
  1) M1 prefers W2 to W1 and
  2) W2 prefers M1 to M2
Then the pair M1-W2 (represented by the red line above) is an unstable pair
because both M1 and W2 prefer each other to their current partners.

Stable Matching:
A perfect matching with no unstable pairs is called a stable matching.

Stable Matching Problem:
Given the preference lists of n men and n women, find a stable matching if one
exists.
